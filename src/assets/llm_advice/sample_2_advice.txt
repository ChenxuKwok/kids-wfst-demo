**Detailed Pronunciation Analysis and Training Tips:**

- **Sound:** The "of" sound as in "animal **of** California" (phoneme /V/)
  - **Error Type:** Deletion
  - **What Happened:** The /V/ sound in "of" was not heard in your reading.
  - **Practice Tip:** Let's practice the /V/ sound. Gently bite your bottom lip with your top teeth and make a soft buzzing sound, like "vvvv." Feel your lips vibrate! Then, try saying words like "van," "vote," or "love."
- **Sound:** The "r" sound as in "Califor**n**ia" (phoneme /R/)
  - **Error Type:** Substitution (you used /N/ instead)
  - **What Happened:** The /R/ sound in "California" sounded like an /N/ sound.
  - **Practice Tip:** Let's work on the /R/ sound. Curl the tip of your tongue back slightly in your mouth, but don't let it touch the roof of your mouth. Make a soft growling sound. Then try saying words like "red," "run," or "right," focusing on that clear /R/ sound.
- **Sound:** The "n" sound as in "Califor**n**ia" (phoneme /N/)
  - **Error Type:** Substitution (you used /AE/ instead)
  - **What Happened:** The /N/ sound in "California" was replaced by an /AE/ sound.
  - **Practice Tip:** To make the /N/ sound, place the front of your tongue gently behind your top front teeth, and hum a soft sound through your nose, like "nnnnn." Try words like "no," "net," or "sun" (focus on the ending /N/ sound).
- **Sound:** The "z" sound as in "gri**zz**ly" (phoneme /Z/)
  - **Error Type:** Substitution (you used /S/ instead)
  - **What Happened:** The /Z/ sound in "grizzly" sounded like an /S/ sound.
  - **Practice Tip:** Let's practice the /Z/ sound. It's like a buzzing bee sound! Make your tongue feel the same as for /S/, but turn your voice on. Try saying "zzzzzz" and then words like "zoo," "zero," or "buzz." Feel the vibration!

**General Training Focus Areas:**

- **Targeting Missing Sounds:** Practice the sounds that you sometimes skip, like the /V/ sound. Try to feel your lips and tongue move in the correct way.
- **Differentiating Similar Sounds:** Pay close attention to the difference between sounds like /R/ and /N/, or /Z/ and /S/. Listening to examples and then recording yourself can help you hear the differences.
- **Slow and Clear:** Reading the text slowly helps you focus on making each sound correctly. Don't rush!
