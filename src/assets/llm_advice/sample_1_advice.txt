**Detailed Pronunciation Analysis and Training Tips:**

- **Sound:** The "great" part of "great white" (phonemes /G R EY T/)
  - **Error Type:** Insertion (you added "they" /DH EY/ before "great")
  - **What Happened:** It sounds like you repeated the word "they" just before saying "great white."
  - **Practice Tip:** When you read, focus on smooth transitions between words. Try reading short phrases like "call me great" or "I am great" slowly. Listen carefully to make sure you only say each word once.
- **Sound:** The "t" sound at the end of "gre**at** whi**te**" (phonemes /T/ and /T/)
  - **Error Type:** Substitution (you used /Z/ instead)
  - **What Happened:** The "t" sound at the end of "great" and "white" sounded like a "z" sound.
  - **Practice Tip:** Let's practice the crisp "t" sound. Put the tip of your tongue behind your top front teeth and quickly push air out, like "t-t-t." Make sure your voice is off. Then try words ending with "t" like "cat," "hat," and "light," making the "t" sound clear and sharp. Compare it to the "z" sound, feeling the difference.

**General Training Focus Areas:**

- **Word Repetitions:** Pay attention to saying each word once as you read. Following along with your finger can sometimes help!
- **Consonant Endings:** Practice making the final consonant sounds of words clear and distinct, especially sounds like /T/ that might get confused with /Z/.
- **Listening Carefully:** Listen to recordings of the original text multiple times. Try to notice how the speaker pronounces the words and sounds, especially those we talked about.
- **Slow and Steady:** Practice reading the text slowly and clearly. Focus on each word and each sound, making sure you get them right before speeding up.
